# CryptoVault

We are creating a proposed advanced online application that uses the Tezos blockchain and React.js to build a decentralized and secure file-sharing network. This platform will focus on addressing key concerns about data security and privacy, allowing the users to share sensitive information with confidence.  

Key features would include secure document uploads to IPFS(InterPlanetary File System), with transactions handled on the Tezos blockchain to ensure safety. The app would integrate with Beacon wallets like Temple to create secure connections for users.  

Additionally, it would provide a simple way to retrieve documents linked to specific addresses, making access quick and efficient. A user-friendly file-sharing function would also allow users to share files securely, enhancing collaboration and making it easy to work together in a trusted environment. Overall, this proposed application aims to improve secure file sharing in a decentralized setting.
